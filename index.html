          <h1>Dive into the Great Barrier Reef!</h2>
          <h2>A little bit about Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The capital is Brisbane, Australia's fastest-growing city and an urban center basking in 300 sunny days each year and within easy reach of the Gold Coast beaches and Lamington National Park. Most of the state's great attractions are up along the coast: the huge Daintree Rainforest, the Outback oases of the Atherton Tablelands and the kaleidoscopic colors of the Great Barrier Reef.</li>

              <li>Palm Cove and Port Douglas make excellent bases, with small-boat cruises exploring the reef, or you can head into the mountains that hug the coastline.</li>

              <li>There are also luxury resorts on a few Great Barrier Reef islands and character accommodation in the heart of the rainforest. It's worth taking time to explore the Outback, with a few nights on a station giving a flavor of this pioneer world.</li>

          <h1>Ski the Swiss Alps!</h1>
          <h2>5 Reasons to Visit Switzerland</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>The Matterhorn:
              <p>You've seen it on boxes of chocolates and calendars (and possibly in an amusement park, too!), but visiting this mountain in person is something truly breathtaking. The Matterhorn is recognized around the globe as the proud symbol of Switzerland. Standing at a staggering 14,692 feet, it challenges mountaineers worldwide and welcomes less energetic visitors as well, to enjoy its tranquil beauty. Whether you're traveling in the winter or summer, a ride on the Gornergrat railway from the village of Zermatt takes you to the starting point of an unforgettable tour that's focused on the legendary mountain.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The waterfalls:
              <p>An inspiration to poets and painters, Switzerland's waterfalls are among the highest and biggest in Europe. Goethe and Byron wrote about the Staubbach Falls in the Bernese Oberland, just one of 72 spectacular falls in the Lauterbrunnen Valley. In the same valley are the mysterious Trumelbach Falls, which are inside the mountain, but open to visitors. The largest waterfall is the Rhine Falls, where you can take pictures from the top. If you dare you can even venture through the mountains and visit the waterfall at night!</p>
            </li>
            <li>Mountain Adventures:
              <p>Visiting the Swiss mountains is a must, and now you have the opportunity to ride high for a low price. Many of Switzerland's peaks are accessible to visitors by cable car or cog railway. If you purchase a Swiss Pass, you benefit from a discount off the price of most trips.  You'll be able to see and experience Swiss mountaintops like never before.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Ticino (Switzerland's Sun Lounge):
              <p>Although not a sizeable country by area, Switzerland is huge in terms of diversity. Situated between Germany, France, Austria and Italy makes for some pretty different cultural activity no matter where you decide to unpack. If youâ€™re looking for Italian flair, venture to the southernmost canton of Switzerland, the Ticino. Ticino is a "land of culture," with plenty of things to do-from both Swiss and Italian food, to music and art performances around every corner. It's also a great region for cycling-from the stunning mountainous scenery and sparkling lakes to the red-roofed village houses clustered along the shores.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Winter sports:
              <p>What kind of guide would this be if we left out winter sports? The breathtaking mountains not only attract poets and painters worldwide but also daredevils looking for thrills. The chic resort of St. Moritz in the Engadin has twice hosted the winter Olympics-and rightfully so, with 217 miles of ski pistes, the Cresta run skeleton track, and the oldest bob run in the world (which is constructed every year of natural ice). Spending any amount of time here, where the action is endless, is the perfect athletic getaway.</p>

          <h1>Bask in the sun in warm Florida!</h1>
          <h2>One of the best reasons to visit Florida is this oceanic expanse of 173,000 acres encompasses most of Biscayne Bay, the Keys and living coral reefs south of Miami. It's one of the largest marine preserves in the United States. The waters are turquoise and crystal clear, making it ideal for fishing, boating, snorkeling, scuba diving and marine gazing in general.
